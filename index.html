        <h2>Short Bio</h2>
        <p id="tribute-info" class="info">
          Susan B. Anthony, in full Susan Brownell Anthony, (born February 15,
          1820, Adams, Massachusetts, U.S.—died March 13, 1906, Rochester, New
          York), American activist who was a pioneer crusader for the women’s
          suffrage movement in the United States and was president (1892–1900)
          of the National Woman Suffrage Association. Her work helped pave the
          way for the Nineteenth Amendment (1920) to the Constitution, giving
          women the right to vote.

        <h2>Abolition, temperance, and women’s suffrage</h2>
        <p class="info">
          Anthony subsequently settled in her family home, now near Rochester,
          New York. There she met many leading abolitionists, including
          Frederick Douglass, Parker Pillsbury, Wendell Phillips, William Henry
          Channing, and William Lloyd Garrison. Soon the temperance movement
          enlisted her sympathy and then, after meeting Amelia Bloomer and
          through her Elizabeth Cady Stanton, so did that of women’s suffrage.
          The rebuff of Anthony’s attempt to speak at a temperance meeting in
          Albany in 1852 prompted her to organize the Woman’s New York State
          Temperance Society, of which Stanton became president, and pushed
          Anthony farther in the direction of women’s rights advocacy. In a
          short time she became known as one of the cause’s most zealous,
          serious advocates, a dogged and tireless worker whose personality
          contrasted sharply with that of her friend and coworker Stanton. She
          was also a prime target of public and newspaper abuse. While
          campaigning for a liberalization of New York’s laws regarding married
          women’s property rights, an end attained in 1860, Anthony served from
          1856 as chief New York agent of Garrison’s American Anti-Slavery
          Society. During the early phase of the Civil War she helped organize
          the Women’s National Loyal League, which urged the case for
          emancipation. After the war she campaigned unsuccessfully to have the
          language of the Fourteenth Amendment altered to allow for woman as
          well as African American suffrage, and in 1866 she became
          corresponding secretary of the newly formed American Equal Rights
          Association. Her exhausting speaking and organizing tour of Kansas in
          1867 failed to win passage of a state enfranchisement law.
